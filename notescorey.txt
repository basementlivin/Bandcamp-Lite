to do:

Link up CRUD routes so they interact with the database

Create reference audio files -> Set up playback functions
    can be achieved by Song.find() and setting the audio property to an
    audio file hosted somehwere else. We can then have the Show routes
    play that audio back on the front end until we can figure out how to upload 
    directly through the upload form to the database.

    Stretch: actually implement file uploading on the site/database


Set up User Auth models and login routes so that the upload access will
    pertain only to the artist page ssociated with the current User.
